### üëã About Me

I am an AI and Platform Engineer passionate about building the full stack of reliable, high-performance developer tools ‚Äî from low-level communication protocols to high-level declarative languages. My work bridges the gap between creative AI potential and production-grade engineering rigor.

My focus is on creating deterministic, toolable, and scalable systems that solve real-world problems for developers and AI agents alike.

### üöÄ The FACET Ecosystem

My work is centered around the **FACET ecosystem**, designed to make AI interactions as rigorous, predictable, and scalable as modern cloud infrastructure. It consists of three core layers:

| Project | Description | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üëë **[FACET Language](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET)** | A **deterministic markup language** for AI instructions. Features first-class contracts and pure lenses. The foundation of the ecosystem. | `Python`, `Parsing`, `Language Design` |
| ‚ö° **[FACET MCP Server](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET_mcp)** | A high-performance, **"Agent-First" execution engine** that provides AI agents with reliable tools for data processing, transformation, and validation. | `Python`, `TypeScript`, `WebSockets`, `SIMD` |
| üß† **[FACET Orchestrator (RMCP)](https://github.com/rokoss21/rmcp-protocol)** | The **AI Operating System & Orchestration Engine** for the ecosystem. Features the "Facet Engine" for intelligent, multi-agent coordination at scale. | `Rust`, `Protocol Design`, `Distributed Systems` |
