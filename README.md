### üëã About Me

I am an AI and Platform Engineer passionate about building developer tools founded on the principles of **determinism, predictability, and engineering rigor**. My work bridges the gap between creative AI potential and the reliability required for production systems.

This philosophy led to the creation of the **[FACET Language](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET)**, a deterministic foundation upon which a larger ecosystem of high-performance AI tools is built.

---

### üöÄ The FACET Ecosystem

My work is centered around the **FACET ecosystem**, a full-stack solution designed to make AI interactions as rigorous, predictable, and scalable as modern cloud infrastructure. Each layer builds upon the last ‚Äî from a deterministic language foundation to a global-scale AI orchestration engine.
