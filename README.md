### üëã About Me

I am an AI and Platform Engineer passionate about building developer tools founded on the principles of **determinism, predictability, and engineering rigor**.

Frustrated by the chaotic, non-deterministic nature of prompt engineering, I set out to replace this "dark art" with a true engineering discipline. This journey led me to create the **[FACET Ecosystem](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET-AGENTS)**, a full-stack platform designed to make AI interactions as reliable and scalable as modern cloud infrastructure.

The ultimate validation of this approach came during a test of the system's "meta-agent" ‚Äî an agent designed to create other agents. When the AI assistant lacked the necessary runtime to execute the task, it didn't fail. Instead, it read the declarative blueprint of the tool it was missing and **synthesized its own interpreter from scratch** to complete the mission.

This moment proved the core philosophy: when you provide AI with structure, it doesn't just become more reliable; it becomes more creative and capable.

**My goal is to build the operating system for the future of AI. If this vision resonates with you, I invite you to explore the ecosystem, starting with the agents themselves.**

### üöÄ The FACET Ecosystem

My work is centered around the **FACET ecosystem**, a full-stack solution designed to make AI interactions as rigorous, predictable, and scalable as modern cloud infrastructure. Each layer builds upon the last ‚Äî from a deterministic language foundation to a global-scale AI orchestration engine.

```sh
$ facetctl diag --arch --wide

[12:07:54] INFO  connecting RMCP orchestrator ....... OK

  facetctl lint ./specs/app.facet
  facetctl run  ./specs/app.facet --input input.json
  fssg build -c site.config.json
  facetctl logs --follow
