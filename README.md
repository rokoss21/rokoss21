### üëã About Me

I am an AI and Platform Engineer passionate about building reliable, high-performance developer tools that bridge the gap between creative AI potential and production-grade engineering rigor. My focus is on creating deterministic, toolable, and scalable systems that solve real-world problems for developers and AI agents alike.

I believe in making complex systems simple, predictable, and a joy to use.

### üöÄ My Flagship Projects

My work is currently centered around the **FACET ecosystem**, designed to make AI interactions as rigorous and reliable as API contracts.

| Project | Description | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üëë **[FACET Language](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET)** | A deterministic markup language for AI instructions, featuring first-class contracts, pure lenses, and a canonical JSON representation. The foundation of the ecosystem. | `Python`, `Parsing`, `Language Design` |
| ‚ö° **[FACET MCP Server](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET_mcp)** | A high-performance, **"Agent-First"** execution engine that provides AI agents with reliable tools for data processing, transformation, and validation. | `Python`, `TypeScript`, `AsyncIO`, `WebSockets`, `SIMD Optimization` |
