### üëã About Me

I am an AI and Platform Engineer passionate about building developer tools founded on the principles of **determinism, predictability, and engineering rigor**. My work bridges the gap between creative AI potential and the reliability required for production systems.

This philosophy led to the creation of the **[FACET Language](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET)**, a deterministic foundation upon which a larger ecosystem of high-performance AI tools is built.

---

### üöÄ The FACET Ecosystem

My work is centered around the **FACET ecosystem**, designed to make AI interactions as rigorous, predictable, and scalable as modern cloud infrastructure. Each layer is a direct application of the core FACET philosophy:

---

### üëë **[FACET Language](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET)**
> The **foundation and source code of the philosophy**. A deterministic markup language for AI instructions, featuring first-class contracts and pure lenses.

**Key Technologies:** <code>Python</code>, <code>Parsing</code>, <code>Language Design</code>

---

### ‚ö° **[FACET MCP Server](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET_mcp)**
> The **application layer**. A high-performance, "Agent-First" execution engine that makes the power of FACET accessible to AI agents as a reliable tool.

**Key Technologies:** <code>Python</code>, <code>TypeScript</code>, <code>WebSockets</code>, <code>SIMD</code>

---

### üß† **[FACET Orchestrator (RMCP)](https://github.com/rokoss21/rmcp-protocol)**
> The **scaling layer**. An AI Operating System & Orchestration Engine that uses the principles of FACET to coordinate entire fleets of AI agents and tools at scale.

**Key Technologies:** <code>Rust</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>FastAPI</code>, <code>Distributed Systems</code>
