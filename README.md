### 👋 About Me

I am an AI & Platform Engineer and the author of **FACET — the Deterministic Contract Layer for AI (since 2025)**.

My work focuses on a single core problem in modern AI systems:  
**the absence of enforceable contracts.**  
Most LLM-based systems rely on best-effort prompts, retries, and post-hoc validation — approaches that do not scale and cannot guarantee correctness.

FACET was created to address this at the **standard level**, not as another framework or wrapper, but as a **formal contract layer** that treats AI behavior as *compiled software*, not probabilistic improvisation.

The FACET standard defines:
- deterministic tool-calling contracts  
- canonical, provider-independent intermediate representation  
- reproducible context allocation and execution semantics  
- explicit conformance levels and adapter requirements  

This work is documented as a public specification and reference architecture, designed to outlive any single vendor, model, or SDK.

The broader FACET ecosystem — compilers, agents, orchestrators — exists to **prove the standard in practice**, not to replace it. Implementations may evolve; the contract remains.

**My goal is to establish deterministic contracts as a baseline expectation for AI systems — in the same way type systems, IRs, and protocols became non-negotiable in traditional software engineering.**

If this direction resonates with you, start with the standard itself:

### 🚀 The FACET Ecosystem

My work is centered around the **FACET ecosystem**, a full-stack solution designed to make AI interactions as rigorous, predictable, and scalable as modern cloud infrastructure. Each layer builds upon the last — from a deterministic language foundation through a high-performance Rust compiler to a global-scale AI orchestration engine.

tips:
  fct build --input app.facet                    # Compile FACET to JSON
  fct run --input app.facet --budget 4096       # Execute with token budget
  fct test --input app.facet                     # Run integrated tests
  facetctl lint ./specs/app.facet                # Validate with orchestrator
  fssg build -c site.config.json                 # Generate static sites
  facetctl logs --follow                         # Monitor agent activity
